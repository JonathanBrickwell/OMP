Version: 0.1.2.0

README for Audiophile music playing program.





COMPILING:

  Run this from the main folder, which has Makefile: time make -j6 -f Makefile

  **NOTE** Change -j6 to -j3 if you have a dual-core processor. Change it to 
    -j9 for a 6-core processor and keep it at -j6 for a quad-core. Following a
    pattern of an additonal 3 for every two cores(1.5 for every 1 core) is 
    an acceptable practice.

  ./MAKEFILE_COMPILE is a script of the command above. You may change it
  at your conveinence.
